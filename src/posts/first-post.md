## The reason
 The reason behind using Gatsby is that I wanted something fast, SEO optimized and easy to maintain to keep my portfolio up to date.

 And it is indeed.


### CSS
CSS modules are used in this project. Grouping some of them will definitely make the files panel look neat-ish.

### Markdown 
Got some cheatsheet here for myself: [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Finishing this blog post
I'll definitely finish this blog post, but there's still a lot of things that I'd like to change before I'll write something about it.

Never been too fond of writing.


### Logo
Meanwhile I'll watch the video of Dev Ed about logo: That's what I need. Don't really care that much about it now... it's just the complier has got an error because the current image is not square.
